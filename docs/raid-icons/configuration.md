# Configuration

The settings live in **`config/cobblemon_raid_icons.properties`**, inside your game folder — the
same `config/` your other mods write to. The file is created with the defaults the first time you
load a world, so start it once and then edit it.

An unreadable or misspelled value never stops the mod: it falls back to its default and says so in
the log.

```properties
scanRadius=12
chunksPerTick=12
onlyActiveDens=false
minTier=0
teraTypes=
```

## The filters

These decide which dens get an icon. They are the settings worth touching.

### `minTier`

The lowest star tier that gets a marker. `0` marks everything.

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `0` | Every den, whatever its tier. The default. |
| `5` | Only 5-star dens and above — the endgame view. |

A den whose tier the mod could not read is always drawn, at any setting. It might be the one you
want, and hiding it on a technicality is worse than one extra icon.

### `teraTypes`

The tera types that get a marker, comma-separated. **Empty means all of them**, which is the default.

```properties
# Only fire and dragon dens
teraTypes=fire,dragon
```

The names are the eighteen types plus `stellar`, lower-case:

`normal` · `fire` · `water` · `electric` · `grass` · `ice` · `fighting` · `poison` · `ground` ·
`flying` · `psychic` · `bug` · `rock` · `ghost` · `dragon` · `dark` · `steel` · `fairy` · `stellar`

An unrecognised name is dropped from the list rather than silently matching nothing.

### `onlyActiveDens`

`true` hides dens that are not currently live. Default `false`, which draws every den whether it is
ready to fight or resetting.

## The scan

The two remaining settings control how the mod looks for dens. The defaults are good; change them
only if you have a reason.

### `scanRadius`

How many chunks out from you are examined. Default `12`, clamped to `1`–`32`.

Raising it past your render distance buys nothing: chunks the game has not loaded hold no dens as
far as this mod is concerned.

### `chunksPerTick`

How many chunks are examined each client tick. Default `12`, clamped to `1`–`64`.

The scan cycles continuously over the whole radius, so this sets how quickly a newly placed den
appears — at the default, the full radius comes round in under three seconds. Each chunk is nearly
free to check, so there is little to gain by lowering it.

## Checking a change took effect

Run [`/raidicons`](commands.md). The `scan` line shows the ground actually being covered, and the
`nearest den` line shows what survived your filters.
